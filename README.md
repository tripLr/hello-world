12-5-18 i compiled a kernel, and it updated to debian desktop with all my old ldlx files. interesting
        so i reloaded full debian. debian is the developers dream. getting used to it is not for noobs, but a good excersize in installing for a server and such
            
12-2-18 i learned if you use command line git, u better be in the folder u want to download everything 
        using this guide, https://kernelnewbies.org/KernelBuild which is similar to the process of building a kernel 
            in FreeBSD. working on my config file...to build
        why build your kernel ? beause of the unneeded code in your distrobution especially for your drivers its for stability.
